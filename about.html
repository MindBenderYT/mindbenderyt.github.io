	<h1> About Jake :) </h1>
  <p> This part of the site tells you a little about me before you see some examples of my work. I am 15 years old and I started programming when I was 12. <br> I started off making small clicker games for my classmates and slowly wrote better code. I am from the United States and I have played bunk town for around 3 months.</p>
